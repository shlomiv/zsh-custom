#+Title: Custom directory for oh-my-zsh
Instead of keeping an entire fork of =oh-my-zsh= just for some personal configuration, I moved everything here.

* Installation
  To install, make sure you install =oh-my-zsh=:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
  #+END_SRC
  
  And then install this and other custom plugins
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd ~/.oh-my-zsh
  rm -rf custom
  git clone https://github.com/vadali/zsh-custom.git custom

  cd custom/plugins
  git clone https://github.com/psprint/zsh-select.git
  git clone https://github.com/psprint/zconvey.git

  ln -sf ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
  #+END_SRC
